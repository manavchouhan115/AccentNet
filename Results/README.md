# Results Overview

This directory captures qualitative and quantitative evidence for AccentNet experiments.

- `audio_samples/` – paired waveforms (source, converted, ground-truth) generated with `Decoder/convert_accent.py`. Filenames follow the pattern `<utterance>_original.wav` for raw audio and `<utterance>_ukconverted.wav` for outputs synthesized by our accent conversion model.

Add folders as needed (e.g., metrics, figures) and keep each subdirectory self-documented so experiments remain traceable.
